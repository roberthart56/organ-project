Documentation for COS organ project 2024 and beyond.

The organ used in worship at COS in Arlington until 2019 was the Rodgers 32B, an analog electronic organ built in the early 1960s.

<br>
In about 1962, COS purchased a state-of-the-art Rodgers 32B electronic organ.  Designed before the advent of integrated circuits, it is built with discrete components, including around three hundred transistors.  The technical manual (available online) has the complete circuit diagram, and one can trace wires, and find every part of the instrument within the console.  The sounds are produced by about 150 individual oscillators, which can be found on panels inside the console, and adjusted as needed.  The Rodgers 32B is a well-built marvel that has survived well beyond its expected lifetime, due to good care, and ministration by Jim Mouradian and others.  
<br>
Jim reworked the output circuits, replaced the power amplifiers, and added a pair of good speakers to the “organ loft” in the steeple room above the entry vestibule.  Jim and Rob also learned how to tune the oscillator circuits and did that together at least twice, usually just before Easter.  Thanks to Jim’s care, we have a workable system for producing sound.  The organ itself, the source of the sound signal, is on its way out.  One or two oscillators are not functioning, and other electronic features no longer work.

In the past year, Casey and Rob, with encouragement from Malia and others, have been exploring the use of virtual organ technology as a possible way to replace the venerable 32B.  A virtual organ uses sounds that have been recorded from existing pipe organs, rather than synthesizing sounds as traditional electronic organs do.  When a key is pressed, a computer running virtual organ software is prompted to find the appropriate sound in its memory, process it as needed, and “play” it using a sound card,  in the same way that it might play any digital music file.  This is all possible because large computer memory and fast computer processors are now cheap and available.  The keyboards communicate with the computer using the MIDI protocol, a system that has been used by musicians for the past forty years or so.  A virtual pipe organ can be realized with standard MIDI keyboards, a reasonably modern computer with a standard sound card, and some good amplifiers and speakers, like the ones in our organ loft.  

<br>

To demonstrate this kind of instrument at COS, Casey and Rob worked together over the summer on a prototype system.  They added sensors and a MIDI converter to an organ pedalboard that Casey had, brought in two MIDI keyboards, and installed applications in their computers from Hauptwerk, one of the leading makers of virtual organ software.  Casey purchased a touch screen to allow quick choices of stop combinations.  The signal from the computer sound card was sent directly to the amplifiers and speakers in the organ loft.  The result is something like a pipe organ - we have been hearing it in our services since on-site worship began again in October.  We hope to discuss soon with others whether it makes sense to pursue a virtual organ as an instrument that we use in the longer term.  We know enough now to be able to propose software and hardware that could create an organ that looks and acts like a traditional instrument with which any organist could be comfortable.  This can be done with standard purchased parts, some assembled by us, at much less cost than replacing the electronic organ or purchasing a pipe organ.
